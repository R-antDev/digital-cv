**I am seeking a **Junior web developer** role to utilize my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and other web-related technologies. I'm also skilled in back-end development with the PHP **Laravel framework**. I have developed websites for various small businesses as well as private clients using the Laravel framework.**

> **Programming Languages**
> 
- **PHP**
    
    My "native" programming language is the one I have been working with for over 1 years. I have a good understanding of OOP concepts and have independently worked on implementing features and fixing issues.
    
- **JavaScript**
    
    I have worked with it for over 1.5 years. I have used it in the front-end with React and Redux, and for testing automation using Jest.
    
- **Python**
    
    I recently started learning about data structures and algorithms with python to expand my knowledge. I find it very interesting, although I'm not proficient yet. I have been solving programming problems on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/imemon_sh) to practice.
